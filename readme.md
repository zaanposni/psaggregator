## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start Self Deployment

First, [download][docker_download_url] and install **Docker**.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.
If you do not want to use certain features (for example the OpenAI Streamingplan Analysis), you can skip the corresponding API keys.

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to run the application. It will start the application and a MySQL database.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

üëÄ You can view the application at `http://localhost:5650`.

You can view the docker logs with `docker-compose logs -f`.

Keep in mind that some data imports might take a while. You can view the progress of the data imports in the docker logs.\
Most data imports are executed periodically. Wait at least an hour before you start to worry about missing data.

That's all you need to know to start! üéâ

## üìù Development

Feel free to contribute to this project. Please read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.

### üí° Overview

This project has four main components:

- **Frontend**: The frontend is a [SvelteKit][svelte_kit_url] application. It is located in the `src/psaggregator` directory.
- **Dataimporter**: The dataimporter is a small project containing multiple python scripts. These scripts are used to import data from the PietSmiet website and various other APIs. The scripts are located in the `src/dataimporter` directory.
- **NGINX**: NGINX is used as a reverse proxy for the frontend. The configuration is located in the `src/nginx` directory.
- **Database**: The database is a MySQL database. The schema and data are located in the frontend project
- **YouTubeOperationalAPI**: The YouTubeOperationalAPI is a Open Source Solution by [Benjamin Loison][benjamin_loison_url]. It supports more features than the official public YouTube API.

### üì¶ Requirements

Depending on the component you want to work on, you will need the following tools:

- **Docker**: Docker `>= 24.0.0` and docker-compose `>= 2.23.0`.
- **Frontend**: Node.js `>= 20.0.0` and npm `>= 9.6.0`.
- **Dataimporter**: Python `>= 3.10.0`.

### üöÄ Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaanposni/psaggregator.git
```

Then, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.
If you do not want to use certain features (for example the OpenAI Streamingplan Analysis), you can skip the corresponding API keys.

Start the MySQL database and YouTubeOperationalAPI:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

Setup the frontend

```bash
cd src/psaggregator
npm install
npm run prismagenerate
npm run prismamigrate  # might be needed if the database is not initialized yet
npm run dev
```

Setup the dataimporter by setting up the environment variables like in the `.env.example` file.\
The dataimporter uses numerous APIs to import data.\
You might want to create API keys for the APIs you want to use and skip the ones you don't want to use.

Start the dataimport scripts (the process is the same for all kind of imports)

```bash
cd src/dataimporter
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 pietsmietdeuploadplan.py  # uploadplan does not need any API key. However - for example - reddit.py does
```
